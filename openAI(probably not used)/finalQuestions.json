        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "H2O has the highest boiling point primarily because of the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules, which are significantly stronger than the dipole-dipole interactions in CH3OH or the weaker dispersion forces in CH4.

            "The solution turns pink, indicating excess NaOH",

        ],
        "answer": 3,
        "explanation": "Phenolphthalein is an acid-base indicator that turns pink in basic solutions and is colorless in acidic solutions. As sodium hydroxide is added to hydrochloric acid, the solution will remain colorless until the equivalence point is reached. At this point, if there is a slight excess of NaOH, the solution will turn pink, indicating that the endpoint has been reached. This color change signifies that the analyte has been completely consumed."

        "options": [
            "The reaction rate will significantly decrease due to increased energy requirements.",
            "The reaction rate will significantly increase as more molecules will have enough energy to overcome the activation energy.",

        ],
        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "According to collision theory, increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of the molecules, resulting in more molecules having energies equal to or greater than the activation energy.

        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "The reaction rate is primarily influenced by the energies of the colliding particles.

        "explanation": "To find the solubility of PbCl2, we set up the Ksp expression based on its dissociation: PbCl2(s) \u21cc Pb\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2Cl\u207b(aq). The Ksp expression is Ksp = [Pb\u00b2\u207a][Cl\u207b]\u00b2. If we let the solubility of PbCl2 be 's', then [Pb\u00b2\u207a] = s and [Cl\u207b] = 2s. The Ksp expression becomes Ksp = s(2s)\u00b2 = 4s\u00b3. Setting this equal to 1.6 x 10\u207b\u2075 allows us to solve for s, resulting in a solubility of approximately 4.0 x 10\u207b\u00b3 mol/L."

Given that the weak acid is in equilibrium, we know that the concentration of the ionized form [H3O+] can be approximated as equal to the concentration of the weak acid, leading to: pH = pKa + log([A\u2212]/[HA]). In the case of a weak acid at the initial concentration with no significant dissociation assumed yet, we consider that at equilibrium, nearly all of the HA is still intact, leading us to calculate the pH as approximately 4.76, so the resulting pH is around 3.76."

For this system at equilibrium, if we let x represent the amount that dissociates, we can write: Ka = (x)(x)/(0.15 - x). Assuming x is much less than 0.15, we can simplify to: 6.3 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.15. Solving for x gives [H3O+] = 3.17 x 10^-3 M, indicating the degree of acidity of the weak acid solution."

        "answer": 4,
        "explanation": "When the concentration of the weak acid is increased, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H3O+) increases as well, leading to a lower pH. However, because pH is logarithmic, the increase in concentration does not lead to a direct one-to-one decrease in pH. Specifically, increasing the concentration by a factor of 10 would decrease the pH by 1 unit, meaning that doubling the concentration will result in an increase of approximately 0.301 units.

        "options": [
            "It ensures the weak acid remains predominantly in its dissociated form",
            "It minimizes the change in color when the solution reaches the equivalence point",

        ],
        "answer": 4,
        "explanation": "The indicator should change color when the pH approaches the equivalence point of the titration. Since the pKa of acetic acid is around 4.8, selecting an indicator with a similar pKa will provide a noticeable color change when the pH rises due to added NaOH, making it easiest to determine the endpoint."

        "explanation": "At the equivalence point of a weak acid-strong base titration, the solution is not neutral due to the presence of the conjugate base formed from the weak acid.
