The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. Essential Knowledge 9.10.A.2: Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. Essential Knowledge 9.10.A.3: The standard cell potential E° corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to E°. Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to E°. In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. Essential Knowledge 9.10.A.4: Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions.
